## FAQ

#### How do I get notifications working?

Momogram has basic UnifiedPush support(enabled by default), but you need to install distributor in order to get it working.

Here are two easy choices for you:

- [ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-android/releases/latest)
- [UP-FCM Distributor (relies on Google, but faster)](https://codeberg.org/UnifiedPush/fcm-distributor/releases)

Just choose one of the distributor from above, install and open it at least once to finish setup, then choose it in the notification settings page of Momogram and you're good to go!

In case of UnifiedPush doesn't work well on your device, you can disable it from Momo general settings (or just search for UnifiedPush) and enable original background service.

Read [UnifiedPush document](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/) for more info

#### Do you take feature requests?

Yes, but it depends, the more useful your suggestion is to the community, the more likely we'll consider implementing it even when it's a bit complex.

In case of a rejection, you may ask if a PR is acceptable.


#### I've encountered a bug!

First, join the discussion group and search around to see if anyone reported the same bug (or a test build with bug-fix exists).

Then, make sure you have the latest version installed (check the channel and the discussion group for latest fixes).

Then, if the issue appears in the official Telegram client too, please submit it to the officials, (be careful not to show Momogram in the description and screenshots, the official developers doesn't like us!).

Then, please *detail* your issue, submit it to our [linked disscussion group](https://t.me/momogram_update) with #bug.

If you experience a *crash*, you also need to click on the version number at the bottom of the settings and select "Enable Log", reproduce the bug again and send it to us.


#### Can you add support for the proxy protocol X(insert any name here)?

Nope. If you can manage to add it yourself without huge amount of modification, maybe we could talk.


#### Why Momogram as the name?

There are too many people that mixes us with Nekogram and the old good NekoX(Nekogram X), so I chose to rename the project.
And for "Momo", it's named after Momoi from Blue Archive, stripped out the "i" for easier pronunciation.

**Important:**

0. Checkout all submodules
